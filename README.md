Chrome extension for surfing .bit sites
=======================================

2018-11-05: The code is now licensed under GPLv2+.

This extension was created to make it as easy as possible for people to surf .bit domains. Download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dotbitme-bit-web-surfer/kkjfoinnbmgmjgmiakbbhggdmccbjhga).

Bit domains are managed by the peer-to-peer [Namecoin network](http://namecoin.info) with no central authority. The system is still at an early stage of development but grows rapidly. The authoritative source for .bit domains is the Namecoin block chain. This means normal DNS servers can currently not be used and surfing .bit domains remains difficult.

This Chrome extension is kicked into action whenever a .bit domain is about to be loaded by the browser. Instead of getting the IP of the domain from the default name servers, it gets the IP via https from app.dotbit.me and redirects the request. Note that even though it uses the chrome.proxy API (http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/proxy), it does not make use of a proxy server (but uses the proxy extension to direct the request to the .bit site IP).

It's in a very early state of development and needs a lot of work - please do not hesitate to contact me if you want to help with the programming or with bugs or feature suggestions.
